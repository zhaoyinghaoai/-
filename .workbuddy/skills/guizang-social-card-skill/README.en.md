[中文 README](./README.md)

An agent skill for Claude Code, Codex, and similar coding-agent environments. It generates **Xiaohongshu / Rednote carousel images**, **Live Photo motion cards**, and **WeChat 21:9 + 1:1 cover pairs** from articles, copy, screenshots, product notes, subtitles, photos, or user-supplied videos.

Two visual systems share one workflow:

- **Editorial**. Restrained layouts in the spirit of *Monocle* / *Kinfolk* / *Cereal*. Best for storytelling, lifestyle, travel, reading, film, and personal observation.
- **Swiss International**. Grid-first, single anchor color, sharp hairlines, extreme type contrast. Best for product reviews, data, frameworks, tutorials, and AI tools.

> Sister project to [guizang-ppt-skill](https://github.com/op7418/guizang-ppt-skill). Shared visual language, separate maintenance. PPT solves "horizontal swipe talks"; this one solves "static feed images."

## 30-second start

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/op7418/guizang-social-card-skill --skill guizang-social-card-skill
```

Or paste this to an AI agent with shell access:

```text
Install guizang-social-card-skill for me. Clone https://github.com/op7418/guizang-social-card-skill into ~/.claude/skills/guizang-social-card-skill, then verify that SKILL.md, assets/, and references/ exist.
```

If you already installed it, update with:

```text
Update guizang-social-card-skill for me. Go to ~/.claude/skills/guizang-social-card-skill, run git pull, then tell me the latest commit.
```

Then ask your agent:

```text
Make me a Swiss-style Xiaohongshu carousel from this article, 5 cards, IKB blue.
```

Other useful prompts:

```text
Make me a 3:4 Xiaohongshu set from this product review, with editorial-style titles.
Turn this article into a WeChat cover pair: 21:9 hero + 1:1 share card, visually consistent.
I have 3 camping photos — make me an image-led Xiaohongshu carousel.
Turn this game guide copy into a Xiaohongshu set; pull some game art from Wallhaven.
I have a coffee video — make it a 5-second Xiaohongshu Live Photo card with text in a quiet zone.
Turn these three game clips into a triple Live Photo collage with Swiss-style guide copy.
```

## What you get

- 🖋 **Two visual systems**: Editorial for atmosphere and narrative, Swiss for facts and structure, sharing one workflow
- 📐 **3 canvas sizes**: `.poster.xhs` 1080×1440 (Xiaohongshu 3:4), `.poster.wide` 2100×900 (WeChat 21:9), `.poster.square` 1080×1080 (WeChat 1:1)
- 🎬 **Live Photo motion cards**: single video, two-grid, three-grid, four-grid, triple collage, and low-cost long-video diagnosis; `5s` for Xiaohongshu, `3s` for WeChat Official Account articles
- 🧩 **28 layout skeletons**: 16 Editorial (`M01-M16`, including Image-Led Cover, Pipeline, Before/After) + 12 Swiss (`S01-S12`, including KPI Tower, H-Bar Chart, Matrix + Hero)
- 🎨 **10 theme presets**: 6 Editorial (Ink Classic, Indigo Porcelain, Forest Ink, Kraft Paper, Dune, **Midnight Ink** dark) + 4 Swiss anchor colors (IKB Klein Blue, Lemon, Lemon Green, Safety Orange)
- 🖼 **Image sourcing workflow**: user images first; otherwise waterfall through Unsplash → Pexels → Flickr CC → Wallhaven → direct search, downloaded locally with auto-generated `SOURCES.md`
- 🌫 **WebGL ink-flow background**: editorial hero pages can ship a live ink animation; can be disabled for low-power devices or screenshot mode
- 🪧 **Text-on-image + subject safety**: full-bleed images require quiet-zone and subject mapping first; add only localized tint when needed, not a default full-canvas mask
- 🧰 **Screenshot beautification assets**: 9 real-texture WebP backgrounds (5 Editorial / 4 Swiss), paired with `.frame-shot` / `.device-browser` / `.device-phone` utilities
- 🗺 **Map component**: MapLibre + OSM real tiles, multi-pin + connectors, made for travel guides
- ✅ **Validator**: `validate-social-deck.mjs` auto-detects overflow, type cap violations, 4-band density gaps, and footer collisions
- 📄 **Single-file HTML + Playwright rendering**: no frontend build pipeline; `node render.mjs` outputs PNG directly

## Live Photo effects and layouts

In this skill, Live Photo means "put the user's video into a social-card layout." It is not random stock-video sourcing and not long-form video editing. First make the first frame work as a still card; then let `3s/5s` of motion add evidence.

| Layout | Effect | Best for |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Single-video motion card | One video cropped to full-canvas `3:4`; when text is needed, use one short headline only and follow `M16 Image-Led Cover` / `image-overlay` rules for subject safety, quiet zones, type, and localized tint | Coffee, travel, fitness moves, product states, game moments |
| Two-grid / three-grid / four-grid puzzle | Multiple video wells inside one Live Photo, usually with no added text so strong footage leads | Travel scenery, fashion picks, room details, food process, workout actions |
| Triple Live Photo collage | Three short clips in parallel, increasing information density inside the short duration; add at most one real scene headline when needed | Guide steps, before/after, multi-angle demos, model test results |
| Long-video diagnosis | Sparse frames / contact sheet for long source videos, then recommend trimming, speed-up, splitting, or asking the user for an exact range | 1-3 minute user videos without a chosen moment |
| Publishing package | Debug `JPG + MOV` plus an iPhone-friendly `.pvt` package | Xiaohongshu and WeChat Official Account article Live Photos |

Judge the information budget first: WeChat `3s` is best for one action point or one state change; Xiaohongshu `5s` can hold one compact process; triple collages are for three parallel results, not a long sequential story.

## Live Photo generation guide

1. **Confirm platform and assets**: user-supplied video is the default input; sourced public video is only for demo / promo testing. Confirm Xiaohongshu, WeChat Official Account article, or local test.
2. **Judge information density**: ask what the viewer can understand in `3s/5s`. If it needs narration, audio, or a full tutorial, do not force it into Live Photo.
3. **Choose the structure**: one strong clip becomes a single-video card; multiple strong clips become two-grid / three-grid / four-grid; three parallel results become a triple collage; long videos get low-cost diagnosis first.
4. **Check the still card first**: the first frame must read as a polished social card. Check crop, subject, text placement, platform safe area, and never turn production requirements into visible audience copy.
5. **Generate motion assets**: output preview video, key JPG, MOV, and `.pvt` inside the task folder; do not write generated files into the skill root.
6. **Deliver with publishing notes**: Xiaohongshu uses `5s`; WeChat Official Account article Live Photo should stay at `3s`; usually transfer the `.pvt` as one package to iPhone and publish from the matching mobile app, because desktop/web paths generally cannot publish Live Photo.

Useful prompts:

```text
Turn this coffee video into a 5-second Xiaohongshu Live Photo. Use only one headline and avoid the cup and hand.
These four travel clips are strong. Make a four-grid Live Photo with no added text.
Make a contact sheet from this 2-minute game video and recommend the best 5 seconds for a guide-style Live Photo.
```

## Fits / Doesn't fit

**✅ Fits**: Xiaohongshu carousels / Live Photo motion cards / WeChat cover pairs / Moments covers / Channels covers / article visuals / tutorial pages / data recaps / travel guides / product reviews / screenshot explainers

**❌ Doesn't fit**: Horizontal swipe decks (use [guizang-ppt-skill](https://github.com/op7418/guizang-ppt-skill)) / long-form video editing / pure photo retouching / plain-text editing without layout

## 11 Xiaohongshu categories

Tiered by "circle of competence" — see [`references/category-cookbook.md`](./references/category-cookbook.md):

**End-to-end strong** (copy / structure / images all in scope):

- Travel, career, recommendations (after specifying a sub-genre)

**Copy and structure strong, images depend on user or sourced art:**

- Gaming, film, food (recipe-oriented), makeup (tutorial-oriented), fitness, home, fashion (curated picks)

**Out of scope, declared upfront** (won't force-fit):

- OOTD live shots / dreamcore / film-emulation grading / real skin-test makeup — anything heavily dependent on photography or post-production

## Common scenarios

| Task | Recommended flow |
|------|------------------|
| Long article → Xiaohongshu carousel | Extract core takeaways; Editorial for narrative pacing, Swiss for data breakdowns |
| Product review / tool wrap-up | Swiss + IKB blue, prefer `S09 KPI Tower` / `S10 H-Bar Chart` |
| Travel / lifestyle | Editorial + Midnight Ink or Dune, `M16 Image-Led Cover` for full-bleed hero |
| WeChat cover pair | Render the same content twice: `.poster.wide` 21:9 + `.poster.square` 1:1, visually consistent |
| Screenshot tutorial / tool walkthrough | `.frame-shot` + `.device-browser`, prefer Swiss grid base |
| Game guide / film recap | Editorial + Midnight Ink, pull game art from Wallhaven for full-bleed hero |
| User video → Live Photo | Judge the `3s/5s` information budget first, then choose single video / puzzle / triple collage / long-video diagnosis |
| Data recap / year in review | Swiss + Lemon or Safety Orange, matrix + ledger combo |

## Why single-file HTML to PNG

- **Agent-friendly**: HTML + CSS is text — agents can write, read, edit, and validate directly
- **Layout precision**: CSS Grid + strict type / margin / grid rules far exceed Markdown's layout reach
- **Open image sourcing**: hook into Unsplash / Pexels / Wallhaven / Mapbox / OSM / any web resource
- **Verifiable quality**: `validate-social-deck.mjs` runs Playwright DOM measurement, not guesswork
- **Simple delivery**: `output/*.png` ships directly — no deploys, no export tools
- **Practical motion-card delivery**: the Live Photo branch exports `JPG + MOV + .pvt`, with Xiaohongshu / WeChat duration limits and mobile publishing paths documented

## Platform support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Claude Code | Supported | Native Skill workflow, ideal for generating + iterating cards |
| Codex | Supported | Good for long-form card generation, sourcing images, visual QA |
| Cursor / other local agents | Works | Requires filesystem read/write + shell execution |
| Plain chatbot | Not recommended | Without filesystem and rendering pipeline, can't reliably ship images |

## Install

### Option 1: One-line install (recommended)

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/op7418/guizang-social-card-skill --skill guizang-social-card-skill
```

### Option 2: Paste this to an AI

> Install the `guizang-social-card-skill` Claude Code skill for me. Steps:
>
> 1. Make sure `~/.claude/skills/` exists (create if not)
> 2. Run `git clone https://github.com/op7418/guizang-social-card-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/guizang-social-card-skill`
> 3. Verify: `ls ~/.claude/skills/guizang-social-card-skill/` should show `SKILL.md`, `assets/`, `references/`
> 4. Tell me when done. Later, saying things like "make me a Xiaohongshu carousel" will trigger this skill.

Paste the block above into Claude Code / Cursor / any AI agent with shell access.

### Option 3: Manual CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/op7418/guizang-social-card-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/guizang-social-card-skill
```

### How to trigger it

Once installed, Claude Code auto-detects the skill. Trigger phrases:

- "Make me a Xiaohongshu / Rednote carousel"
- "Make me Rednote cards"
- "Make a WeChat 21:9 hero + 1:1 share card"
- "Generate social cards / magazine-style social cards"
- "Turn this article into a tutorial carousel"
- "Make a Swiss-style Xiaohongshu review / IKB-style cards"
- "Turn this video into a Xiaohongshu Live Photo / triple Live Photo collage"
- "Make a 3-second Live Photo for a WeChat Official Account article"

## Workflow

The skill is a structured workflow. The agent walks through 7 steps:

1. **Intake** — capture 4 things: target platform / style / source content / user images. When no images are available, present A/B/C once (shoot your own / AI generate / source online); don't re-pitch
2. **Style & Theme** — pick Editorial or Swiss, then pick one of 10 theme presets. Custom hex values are not allowed
3. **Layout Selection** — pick / paste / adapt copy from the 28 layout skeletons. 16 Editorial / 12 Swiss
4. **Asset Prep** — source images (Unsplash / Pexels / Flickr CC / Wallhaven / direct search), download locally + write `SOURCES.md`; ask whether to credit sources
5. **Compose & Render** — copy seed template → replace `<!-- POSTERS_HERE -->` → `node render.mjs`
6. **Deliver & Review** — show PNGs first, ask "look at them yourself, or want me to run the validator?" — does not auto-validate
7. **Iterate** — apply user feedback, tweak inline styles or swap layouts / images, re-render

Live Photo requests branch inside Step 5: judge the `3s/5s` information budget, inspect the first frame or a sparse contact sheet for crop safety, then export `JPG + MOV + .pvt`. Delivery notes include platform limits and publishing paths: `5s` for Xiaohongshu, `3s` for WeChat Official Account articles, usually transferred to iPhone and published from the matching mobile app.

Full spec in [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md). Deep details in the matching `references/*.md`.

## Validator

```bash
node validate-social-deck.mjs path/to/task-dir
```

9 rules, based on Playwright real-render measurement, not static scanning:

- **R1** Overflow — any section overflowing `.poster` fails immediately and reports a pixel-based fix tier
- **R2** Footer Collision — content pressing into the bottom footer / page-number
- **R3** Swiss Bold Display — Swiss large titles violating "bigger means thinner"
- **R4** Min Readable Font — body, captions, labels, and metadata below mobile-readable floors
- **R5** 4-Band Density — 1440-tall canvas split into 4 horizontal bands; each must hold content or have a stated whitespace reason
- **R6** H-XL Line Cap — `.h-xl` / `.h-display` / `.h-statement` line counts exceeding board budgets
- **R7** Figure Margin Drift — default browser `<figure>` margins causing layout drift
- **R8** Visual Bounds — true visible top/bottom bounds, visual overflow, and bottom whitespace
- **R9** Title Gap — display title too close to the next content block

`SKILL.md` Step 7 explicitly states **the validator does not auto-run** — wait for the user to look at the images first, saving tens of seconds per round.

## Theme presets

Pick from [`references/theme-presets.md`](./references/theme-presets.md). **Custom hex values are not allowed** — protecting the aesthetic matters more than freedom of choice.

### Editorial (6)

| Theme | Tones | Best for |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 🖋 **Ink Classic** | `#0a0a0b` / `#f1efea` | General default, commercial topics, when in doubt |
| 🌊 **Indigo Porcelain** | `#0a1f3d` / `#f1f3f5` | Tech, research, AI, technical writing |
| 🌿 **Forest Ink** | `#1a2e1f` / `#f5f1e8` | Nature, sustainability, outdoors, non-fiction |
| 🍂 **Kraft Paper** | `#2a1e13` / `#eedfc7` | Nostalgia, humanities, reading, literature |
| 🌙 **Dune** | `#1f1a14` / `#f0e6d2` | Art, design, creative, fashion |
| ⚫ **Midnight Ink** | `#0e0d0c` / `#ece2cf` / `#d4a04a` | Game key art / night scenes / cinematic covers / Black Myth · Elden Ring-style dark themes |

### Swiss (4)

| Theme | Anchor | Best for |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 🔵 **IKB Klein Blue** | `#002FA7` | General default, commercial launches, AI products, frameworks |
| 🟡 **Lemon** | `#FFD500` | Youth, sports, retail, consumer, Y2K |
| 🟢 **Lemon Green** | `#C5E803` | Eco, health, Gen Z, green brands |
| 🟠 **Safety Orange** | `#FF6B35` | Alerts, news, industrial, energetic themes |

To switch themes, just replace the `<section class="poster" data-theme="...">` attribute on the seed template; all CSS resolves through `var(--...)`.

## Core design principles

1. **Restraint over loudness** — restrained palettes stand out in a saturated feed
2. **Structure over decoration** — type / contrast / grid carries the hierarchy, not shadows or cards
3. **Layouts over freedom** — pick first, adapt later; do not invent pages outside the 28 skeletons
4. **User images first** — at intake, present A/B/C once; do not re-pitch shooting their own
5. **Select and avoid first** — full-bleed images need a quiet zone; text drop zones must clear the subject (faces / products / text-dense regions); add localized tint only when needed
6. **Bigger means thinner** — Swiss `.h-xl` size goes up → weight must come down. Editorial follows the same rule
7. **No auto-validation** — let the user look first, then ask before validating; saves tens of seconds per round
8. **A skill is a product, not a prompt** — has PRODUCT.md, version numbers, CHANGELOG, capability boundaries
9. **Local tests stay out of git** — all demos / smoke tests live under `local-tests/`, gitignored
10. **Treat video as a card first** — a Live Photo first frame must work as a good social card; visible copy should describe the real scene, not production terminology

## Visual references

- *Monocle* / *Kinfolk* / *Cereal* magazine layouts and letter spacing
- Massimo Vignelli / Helvetica Forever / Swiss International Typographic Style grid systems
- Apartamento / The Gentlewoman image-to-text ratios and human portraiture
- Restrained-wins-the-feed samples from Xiaohongshu / Rednote
- Guizang's social card practice

## Roadmap

- More smoke tests for type-cap edge cases under long Editorial content
- More Swiss data layouts (additional chart skeletons)
- Post-image-generation: actively ask whether to do local fixes / regenerate the whole image
- More category-specific recommended layout packs (currently 7 of 11 are end-to-end strong)
- Expand the Live Photo example library: single video, puzzles, game guides, lifestyle, product updates
- Marketplace-ready WorkBuddy version

## FAQ

**Can I batch-export images?**
Yes. A task directory's `index.html` can hold multiple `.poster` sections; `node render.mjs` screenshots each one. A 3-9 card Xiaohongshu set is the common case.

**Why are custom colors disallowed?**
Same reason as the PPT skill — the skill's core value is stable output. Free color picking breaks visual cohesion. Pick from the 10 presets only.

**Can I use other models for image generation?**
Yes. Image generation itself is out of scope. SKILL.md Step 4 spells out the sourcing protocol: user images → AI-generated → web sources. AI generation depends on whichever model your agent connects to.

**Does it support Live Photo?**
Yes. Plan for `5s` on Xiaohongshu and `3s` inside WeChat Official Account articles. It supports single video, two-grid, three-grid, four-grid, triple collage, and sparse long-video diagnosis. Publishing usually requires the mobile path; desktop upload flows generally cannot recognize `.pvt` as a publishable Live Photo.

**Codex output drifts off-spec — what do I do?**
Since v0.12 the rule "seed templates and components.md table stay in sync" is a hard constraint. If a violation slips through, it's almost always seed-template defaults diverging from `references/style-system.md` — open an issue.

**How do I update?**
Re-run the install command, or `git pull` in your local skill directory.

**Does it support English content?**
Yes. Editorial's Playfair Display + Noto Serif and Swiss's Inter + Helvetica all cover Chinese and English. Layout skeletons are language-agnostic.

## Contributing

Bugs, layout issues, new layout requests — Issues and PRs welcome. Priorities for changes:

- When editing seed templates, also update `references/components.md`'s correspondence table (sizes / spacing / weights)
- When adding layouts, add the full recipe to `references/layout-recipes.md` (copy caps + minimum density)
- When adding theme colors, also update the seed template's `[data-theme="..."]` block + `references/theme-presets.md`
- When adding Swiss rules, also update the matching rule in `validate-social-deck.mjs`
- Mistakes you've hit go into `references/qa-checklist.md`
- Tests and demos live under `local-tests/` — do not pollute the skill root
